The behaviors vary in the extent to which the sales associate may: direct a conversation toward a commitment or sale, listen carefully to customers and provide options that address what they really need/want, put aside work to assist a customer, and focus on meeting customer needs. Responses are tracked and compared against expert ratings of effectiveness.

It provides a highly visual profile of a candidate's strengths and limitations against identified required competencies. Includes a summary table that enables prioritisation of action planning for development of critical competencies for an individual (by tabling Competency Potential against Job Importance for the role). It includes highly descriptive statements about a candidate's strengths and development  needs/limitations. \r\nThe extended report versions include proposed competency-based interview questions \r\nto enable probing of specific situations in which the candidate might have \r\ndemonstrated critical job behaviours. \r\n  \r\nThe PJM Report is designed for use by line managers and HR professionals in selection and \r\ndevelopment situations. It is valuable for identifying an individual's overall fit as well as likely areas of \r\nstrength and weakness relative to their behaviour at work. \r\n \r\nIn a selection context, this information can be used: For making interviewers aware of the areas that may need further probing.

Situations are presented to the candidate via computer-based animation, and the candidate is offered a set of behaviors from which to choose the most and least effective responses. The behaviors vary in the extent to which the sales associate may: direct a conversation toward a commitment or sale, listen carefully to customers and provide options that address what they really need/want, put aside work to assist a customer, and focus on meeting customer needs. Responses are tracked and compared against expert ratings of effectiveness. The test produces an overall score, as well as scores on two subscales, Customer Service Effectiveness and Sales Effectiveness.",

Sample tasks for these jobs include: interact with customers on the phone to sell a product/service; add new or upgraded products or services; extend promotional or retention offers; respond appropriately to customer objections; navigate to information menus to assist the customer and process information; and type information quickly and accurately. Potential job titles that use this simulation are: Telesales Representative, Telemarketer, and Contact Center Representative. The behavioral tests in this solution are intended to measure the candidate\u2019s sales focus, learning potential, and the tendency to meet goals and work hard, even when faced with obstacles. Collectively, the assessments in this solution measure a wide range of important skills, abilities, and behaviors for entry-level contact center roles involving sales or sales and service.",
